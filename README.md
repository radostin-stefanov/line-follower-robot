Line follower robot

This is the firmware of a 2-wheel robot which follows a curved line. Because this requires some settings, the robot includes an on-board OLED display through which the parameters are visualized. The display draws a menu and its items are selected using 4 buttons -- UP, DOWN, SELECT, BACK. The UP and DOWN buttons are also used to increment and decrement the values of the parameters.
